{"item_description":"The pilot's room in Brunsbüttel was built in 1895 in connection with the construction of the Kiel Canal in the entrance area to the old locks. In 2007, the old pilot's house in Brunsbüttel was replaced by a new building with modern equipment to meet today's requirements. The old pilot's room, with its historic wood paneling, old furniture, other equipment and paintings, was handed over to the German Port Museum by the Elbe Pilots' Brotherhood, salvaged by them and has been on display in the exhibition depot since 2012. Pilot's rooms served as important waiting stations for the pilots, especially before the times of radar, GPS, AIS, cell phones and the use of cars, who spent their waiting time here before they looked after the ships that required piloting in accordance with the \"Börtordnung\". The pilot's house was like a large hotel and the pilot's room offered a waiting and lounge area, an information exchange and was an important place for professional exchange.","item_name":"Pilot's room of Brunsbüttel"}
