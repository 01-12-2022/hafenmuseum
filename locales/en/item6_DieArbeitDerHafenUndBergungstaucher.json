{"item_description":"For water work, repairs to locks, when equipment has fallen into the water, in the event of shipwrecks, after launches or for inspection, even to recover ammunition - in these cases, diving was necessary. A diving group consists of the diver, the signalman, the pumpmen and other assistants. The signalman is responsible for the group alongside the diving leader. He controls the technical system, knows about the dangers, and knows how to carry out emergency first aid. He leads the signal line, is responsible for the diver's proper dressing, for his safety when descending and ascending, and for setting up, keeping ready and retrieving the signal line and hose. The operating crew works on the signalman's orders. As long as the diver is in a closed suit, pumping must not be interrupted under any circumstances. At least a second diver is available for difficult tasks. The descent takes place on the bottom rope or via a ladder. In tidal waters, work is only possible when there is backwater. At greater depths, the diver can only work by feeling his way. The length of stay depends on the water depth. If you are diving with the heavy helmet diving equipment, a few safety precautions must be taken before putting on the diving equipment. The diver checks all the equipment himself, paying particular attention to the proper functioning of the helmet valves. As the diving suit does not provide any thermal insulation, the diver puts on long woolen underwear. Then the suit is put on. The diver climbs through the opening of the elastic rubber collar - in the case of a three-bolt suit with the help of four assistants who pull the collar wide apart. The German Port Museum has a very rare pneumatic collar spreader, of which only three examples still exist.","item_name":"The work of harbour and salvage divers"}
