{"item_description":"Once the work is finished, the ascent begins, which, like the descent, is just as dangerous. For professional divers, work often does not begin until below 40 meters. For this reason, long decompression periods are carried out at precisely defined decompression levels at different water depths. At these levels, the diver pauses and breathes out the nitrogen that is now slowly escaping from the tissues. The decompression levels decrease by 3 meters each time towards the surface, but the pauses become increasingly longer. When you surface, the nitrogen dissolved in the body is excreted in the form of tiny bubbles. If you ascend gradually, nothing happens, but if you come up quickly, it is like a lemonade bottle that is suddenly opened. The nitrogen bubbles destroy the tissue and can lead to pulmonary embolisms. For this reason, the diver must then be brought back under high pressure as quickly as possible, which slows down the expansion of the gas bubbles. There are pressure or decompression chambers for this purpose - airtight, pressure-resistant containers for the controlled increase or decrease of air pressure so that divers can adjust to atmospheric pressure again after long and deep missions. They may have to stay in them for several hours. The longer the diver is exposed to the pressure, the more nitrogen gas penetrates the body.
