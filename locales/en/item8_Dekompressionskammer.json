{"item_dekompressionskammer_description":"After completing their work, divers begin the ascent, which, like the descent, is associated with risks. For professional divers, the work often starts below 40 meters. Therefore, long decompression times are required at precisely defined decompression stages, which are at various depths. At these stages, the diver pauses and breathes out the nitrogen that is slowly leaving the tissues. The decompression stages decrease by 3 meters each time as the diver approaches the surface, with the pauses becoming progressively longer. During ascent, the dissolved nitrogen is released in the form of tiny bubbles. A gradual ascent causes no issues, but a rapid rise is akin to opening a bottle of soda suddenly. Nitrogen bubbles can damage tissue and lead to pulmonary embolisms. Therefore, the diver must be quickly brought back under high pressure to slow the expansion of the gas bubbles. For this purpose, there are pressure or decompression chambers—airtight, pressure-resistant containers used to control the increase or decrease of air pressure so that divers can readjust to atmospheric pressure after long and deep dives. In some cases, they may need to remain inside for several hours. The longer the diver is exposed to pressure, the more nitrogen gas enters the body.\n\nDiving Pressure Chamber: Bugsier-, Reederei- und Bergungs-Gesellschaft mbH & Co.
