{"item_description":"Around 1900, the increase in maritime cargo handling with ever-larger ships necessitated extensive renovations and expansions of the Port of Hamburg. As a result, from 1908 to 1909, the 271-meter-long and 48-meter-deep warehouses 50 and 51 were built along the wall at Bremer Kai, and in 1911, a residential building for quay officials was constructed. Around the same time, warehouses 52 and 53 were built at Australiakai, which is situated near Indiahafen. Warehouse 50, like the others, stood out for its lightweight wooden construction in the style of a three-aisled hall church. This type of construction was not only relatively inexpensive but also allowed for quick reconstruction in the event of a fire. The raised central aisle allowed for good natural lighting. The warehouses were equipped with electric semi-portal cranes on the waterside, and both the quay and land ramps were accessible for carriages and trains. All these factors enabled the rapid handling of goods. The builders added brick end buildings to the gable ends of the warehouses. These housed offices for quay administration, recreation and sanitary facilities for the dockworkers, and official apartments for the quay officials. In addition to the trend-setting shed architecture, the facilities in the end buildings represented a new level of social care for the workers employed in the port. Until the late 1960s, South American traffic was handled via the Bremer Kai. At the end of the 1960s, the Port of Hamburg underwent a structural change due to the \"container revolution,\" which led to the demolition of large parts of the modern port. Warehouses 50â€“52 and the residential building for quay officials have been listed as historic monuments since 2002. Warehouse 53 was demolished.","item_name":"Shed 50"}
