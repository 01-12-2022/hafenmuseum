{"item_description":"The PEKING is the first visible object in the collection of the German Port Museum. The four-masted barque is one of the last large cargo ships that could still compete with steam and machine ships at the beginning of the 20th century due to its speed, safety and precision. The ship served as a transport ship for the saltpeter from Chile, which was in high demand at the time. The PEKING was built in 1911 by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg. In 1932 she was sold to the Shaftesbury Homes & Arethusa Training Ship Company, renamed ARETHUSA and used as a school and boarding school ship on the River Medway east of London. In 1974 the ship was auctioned and served as a museum ship for the South Street Seaport Museum in New York. In 2017 the unseaworthy PEKING was returned to Germany, extensively renovated and has been part of the Hamburg Historical Museums Foundation since 2020.","item_name":"Peking"}
