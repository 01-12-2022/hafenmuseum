{"item_description":"The Imperator (HAPAG used the masculine article at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II) was built at the Vulkan shipyard in Hamburg. When it was launched on May 23, 1912, it was the largest ship in the world at the time, with 52,117 gross register tons. The Imperator's godfather in 1913 was Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Imperator class included the largest German passenger ships built in Hamburg by the HAPAG shipping company. In order to be able to guarantee a weekly departure from Europe to America, Albert Ballin pushed through the construction of a fleet of fast steamers. The lead ship Imperator was built by AG Vulcan, the two sister ships Vaterland and Bismarck by Blohm & Voss, with the length and size of the ships being increased each time. The construction of these ships was also a response to the previously started construction of the Olympic class of the White Star Line, which also included the RMS Titanic.","item_name":"TD Emperor"}
